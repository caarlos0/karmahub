Compares the amount of issues and pull requests you created with the amount
of comments and code reviews you did.

The idea is to use it at your daily job organization, so you can get an idea
of how much are you actually contributing to the code review practices.

For example, at the company I work, the "rule of thumb" is
"for each pull request you open, do 3 code reviews".

I can check my progress like this:

So, in this scenario, its clear that I'm not following the rule.

Hope this helps you and your team improve the code review practices!
